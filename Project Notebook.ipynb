    "Let me tell you a story. \n",
    "Once upon a time, a UCSD student wanted to explore new unknown lands and on a map, and she discovered a beautiful island named `COGS 18: Introduction to Python`. It really caught her eye because of how mysterious it sounded, so she soon set off to the faraway land. Once she arrived on the island, she met a wonderful mentor who taught her everything she needed and handed her the tools to successfully reach the peak of a beautiful mountain on the island. The mountain called, `The Final Project`, would be a challenge, but the student was determined. As the student climbed the mountain, she took two tools from her backpack. The first tool was a gift from her mentor called `A3 about ChatBots` and the other was called `A5 about DataFrames`. Both tools, along with nutritious food called `consistent syntax` (made out of delicious `PEP8`) made her want to keep on walking towards the peak. She left breadcrumbs (`docstrings`) along the way so that others could follow in her footsteps and also used a flashlight (`asserts`) to guide her. Yet why did she want to climb the mountain? She carved it down on a tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?**\n",
    "- Help my family with the toy business `skytoy.co`\n",
    "- Explore user experience from a little kidâ€™s point of view (my little sister helped)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process:**\n",
    "- Analyze a dataset for `skytoy.co`\n",
    "- Extract only necessary information\n",
    "- Interact with the user, receive input\n",
    "- Similar to a BuzzFeed quiz \n",
    "- Choose a random toy based on their areas of interest\n",
    "- Kids can find their perfect toy\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you for your help and for allowing me to make this project a reality. Hope to see you again on the next adventure!  :)"

Before starting my code, I thought I was going to do use the function commmon_category and the function toy_features to find the perfect toy for the kid, but then I realized that it was better to do the questions and I used a third function that used the other two and also printed it.\n",
